WellsFLIX performed a migration of the 404 error page away from being Google hosted. WellsFLIX plans for one more major backend change. This migration is being performed in an effort to completely move all WellsFLIX services off of the Google platform to ensure privacy and security. The following final change is currently being evaluated and planned for the future to complete the migration.

1. Fully migrate the domain name to Cloudflare.
