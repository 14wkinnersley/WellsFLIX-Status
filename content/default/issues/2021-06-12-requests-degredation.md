The backend of the requests application (Overseerr) is currently unavailable due to a recent failed patch from the developers of the backend applications. The frontend Requests application is still available, and requests will be accepted; however requests will not be processed and added into Plex until the developers release an update fixing the problem. WellsFLIX admin is working closely with the developers to provide logs and assistance to restore the application. ETR is unknown at this time.
