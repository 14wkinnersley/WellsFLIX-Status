The backend of the requests application (Overseerr) was unavailable due to a recent failed patch from the developers of the backend applications. The frontend Requests application was still available, and requests were accepted; however requests were not processed and added into Plex until the developers release an update fixing the problem. Developers have resolved the issue, and requests are functioning as intended.
