WellsFLIX performed a major change with the WellsFLIX homepage at https://wellsflix.com that may cause issues to the user community. If you are experiencing any issues, please clear your browser cache, or delete any bookmarks of the homepage and re-add.

\
This change migrated the homepage away from being Google hosted. WellsFLIX plans for more backend changes to come. This migration is being performed in an effort to completely move all WellsFLIX services off of the Google platform to ensure privacy and security. The following changes are being evaluated and planned for the future to complete the migration:

1. Migrate the 404 page (https:// error.wellsflix.com) to a self hosted platform and securely using Cloudflare.

2. Fully migrate the domain name to Cloudflare. 



For any questions, please feel free to contact the WellsFLIX admin.
